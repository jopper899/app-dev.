**Stranger Things** is one of my all-time favorite Netflix series. It mixes *science fiction*, *horror*, and *drama* perfectly while showing the strong bond of friendship and courage among a group of kids in the 1980s.

### Extra Notes
That is so funny! :joy:  
I need to highlight these ==very important moments== in every season.

H~2~O represents water in one episode where science was discussed, and X^2^ reminds me of the mystery behind the Upside Down.

- [x] Watch all four seasons  
- [ ] Wait for season 5 release  
- [ ] Buy Stranger Things merchandise
